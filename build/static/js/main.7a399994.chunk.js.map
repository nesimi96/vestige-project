Black Orchid je poseban, opojan cvjetni miris, pomiješan s vrucom cokoladom i zemljanim paculijem, lagano poškropljen svježom mentom. Ovaj mirisni splet dodatno je oplemenjen vanilijom. Black Orchid karakteriziraju bogati i tamni akordi, uz zavodljiv spoj crnih orhideja i senzualne šume. Black Orchid je tajanstvena ljepotica u crnoj bocici.\", \n            names: {\n                UI: \"Black Orchid\",\n                img: \"tom-ford-black-orchid-big\",\n                route: \"/parfem/tom-ford/black-orchid\",\n            },\n            notes: [\"artemizija\", \"lavanda\", \"kardamon\", \"nana\", \"bergamot\", \"cvijet naranče\", \"kim\"],\n            sex: 'men',\n            price: {\n                big: {discount: \"0\", ml: \"100ml\", price: \"3000\"},\n                medium: {discount: \"1200\", ml: \"55ml\", price: \"2400\"}\n            }\n        },\n    ]*/\n}\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/about.dde34190.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/header-background.424ac7be.jpg\";","import React from 'react';\n\n\nconst Copyright = () => {\n    return <div style={{\n        color: '#fff',\n        fontStyle: 'italic'\n    }}>Vestige {new Date().getFullYear()}. </div>\n}\n\nexport default Copyright;","import React from 'react';\nimport '../../sass/main.scss';\n\nconst Hamburger = () => {\n    return <div className=\"Hamburger\">\n               <div className=\"Hamburger-item\"></div>\n           </div>\n}\n\nexport default Hamburger","import React from 'react';\nimport LogoImg from '../../assets/images/logo.png';\n\nconst Logo = () => {\n   return <img style={{\n       width: '100%', height: '100%',\n   }} src={LogoImg} alt=\"Logo-image\"/>\n}\n\nexport default Logo;","import React from 'react';\n\nconst SearchIcon = () => {\n    return <svg style={{\n        fill: 'white', width: 20, height: 20\n    }} version=\"1.1\" id=\"Capa_1\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\"\n    viewBox=\"0 0 511.999 511.999\" >\n<g>\n   <g>\n       <path d=\"M508.874,478.708L360.142,329.976c28.21-34.827,45.191-79.103,45.191-127.309c0-111.75-90.917-202.667-202.667-202.667\n           S0,90.917,0,202.667s90.917,202.667,202.667,202.667c48.206,0,92.482-16.982,127.309-45.191l148.732,148.732\n           c4.167,4.165,10.919,4.165,15.086,0l15.081-15.082C513.04,489.627,513.04,482.873,508.874,478.708z M202.667,362.667\n           c-88.229,0-160-71.771-160-160s71.771-160,160-160s160,71.771,160,160S290.896,362.667,202.667,362.667z\"/>\n   </g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n</svg>\n\n}\n\nexport default SearchIcon;","import React from 'react';\n\nconst CartSvg = () => {\n    return <svg style={{\n        fill: '#fff', width: 24, height: 24\n    }} id=\"Capa_1\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 512 512\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" ><path d=\"m504.399 185.065c-6.761-8.482-16.904-13.348-27.83-13.348h-98.604l-53.469-122.433c-3.315-7.591-12.157-11.06-19.749-7.743-7.592 3.315-11.059 12.158-7.743 19.75l48.225 110.427h-178.458l48.225-110.427c3.315-7.592-.151-16.434-7.743-19.75-7.591-3.317-16.434.15-19.749 7.743l-53.469 122.434h-98.604c-10.926 0-21.069 4.865-27.83 13.348-6.637 8.328-9.086 19.034-6.719 29.376l52.657 230c3.677 16.06 17.884 27.276 34.549 27.276h335.824c16.665 0 30.872-11.216 34.549-27.276l52.657-230.001c2.367-10.342-.082-21.048-6.719-29.376zm-80.487 256.652h-335.824c-2.547 0-4.778-1.67-5.305-3.972l-52.657-229.998c-.413-1.805.28-3.163.936-3.984.608-.764 1.985-2.045 4.369-2.045h85.503l-3.929 8.997c-3.315 7.592.151 16.434 7.743 19.75 1.954.854 3.99 1.258 5.995 1.258 5.782 0 11.292-3.363 13.754-9l9.173-21.003h204.662l9.173 21.003c2.462 5.638 7.972 9 13.754 9 2.004 0 4.041-.404 5.995-1.258 7.592-3.315 11.059-12.158 7.743-19.75l-3.929-8.997h85.503c2.384 0 3.761 1.281 4.369 2.045.655.822 1.349 2.18.936 3.983l-52.657 230c-.528 2.301-2.76 3.971-5.307 3.971z\"/><path d=\"m166 266.717c-8.284 0-15 6.716-15 15v110c0 8.284 6.716 15 15 15s15-6.716 15-15v-110c0-8.284-6.715-15-15-15z\"/><path d=\"m256 266.717c-8.284 0-15 6.716-15 15v110c0 8.284 6.716 15 15 15s15-6.716 15-15v-110c0-8.284-6.716-15-15-15z\"/><path d=\"m346 266.717c-8.284 0-15 6.716-15 15v110c0 8.284 6.716 15 15 15s15-6.716 15-15v-110c-.001-8.284-6.716-15-15-15z\"/></svg>\n}\n\nexport default CartSvg;","import React from 'react';\n\nconst BackDirection = (props) => {\n\n    return <svg style={props.style} version=\"1.1\" id=\"Capa_1\"  x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\"\n    viewBox=\"0 0 341.333 341.333\" >\n<g>\n   <g>\n       <polygon points=\"341.333,149.333 81.707,149.333 200.853,30.187 170.667,0 0,170.667 170.667,341.333 200.853,311.147 81.707,192 \n           341.333,192 \t\t\"/>\n   </g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n<g>\n</g>\n</svg>\n\n}\n\nexport default BackDirection;","import React from 'react';\nimport '../../../../sass/main.scss';\n\nconst SearchItem = (props) => {\n\n   const parfum = props.parfum;\n   const route = parfum.names.route;
